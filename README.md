# Local Search and Constraint Satisfaction Problems


The goal of this assignment is for students to implement and demonstrate an understanding of a variety of fundamental local search and Constraint Satisfaction Problems algorithms.

For each algorithm, you must provide a functional and well-documented implementation. It is recommended that you use a single example problem to demonstrate the functionality of each algorithm.
